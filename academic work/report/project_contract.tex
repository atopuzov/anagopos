English$:$ Visualization of $\beta$-reduction-graphs in the lambda calculus.\\
Danish$: $ Visualisering af $\beta$-reduktionsgrafer i lambda kalkyler.

\section{Introduction}

The aim of the project is to develop a method to visualize reduction graphs in
the lambda calculus, so that they are ``beautiful'' and informative for
theoretical computer scientists. This includes: developing a parser for some
notation of the lambda calculus, developing a program that can compute the
reduction graphs, and developing a program that, given a reduction graph, can
visualize it in an intuitive way, at least for theoretical computer
scientists.

% Expected result 

The expected result is a program that takes a lambda term, as input, and draws
the $\beta$-reduction-graph as it develops after each iteration of reductions.
These reduction graphs can thus be regarded as a ``film'', with each frame
depicting the look of the reduction graph after reduction $n$.

% Why is the project useful? 

Our program is supposed to be used by researchers to infer knowledge about
pros and cons of a reduction strategy or of a certain lambda term. It will
provide inspiration for further investigations into previously unknown
peculiarities or problems with a certain reduction strategy.

Thus far there doesn't exist a proper, automatic way of visualizing these
graphs. Researchers are limited to what they themselves can draw or imagine,
and as reduction graphs becomes huge, this becomes a difficult task.

% What is particularly difficult/of high risk?

Because reduction graphs very often tend to become huge, there arises the
problem of deciding whether they can be drawn on a plane at all. We will
perhaps have to develop a routine for deciding this, along with routines for
reordering the graph. Alternatively, a set of ``best practices'' for drawing
the nodes could be developed that would minimize the amount of crossing edges
as the film progresses forward. Yet more alternatively, methods for 3D-drawing
could be considered. However, this will demand great care when determining the
look of the images, as a 3-dimensional rendering of a large graph very easily
could inhibit understanding and confuse the beholder, which is the opposite of
what we are working towards.

Furthermore, there is a design choice to be made whether each frame of the
film should be drawn immediately after the reduction step has been completed,
making the film rendering and the term reductions synchronized, or whether the
rendering should begin only after all desired (or possible) reductions have
been computed.

\section{Specific Project Objectives}
The specific objective in this project is to create a visualization of $\beta$-reduction-graphs in the lambda calculus. This will include tasks in the 3 following main areas:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The lambda calculus theory
	\item Visualization and graph theory
	\item Python development of the visualization software
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The lambda calculus theory}
This part is not particular large, but still remains as an essential part of the project. Without a reasonably good understanding of lambda calculus and $\beta$-reduction-graphs it will not be possible to complete the project with a satisfactory outcome. A review on lambda calculus and $\beta$-reduction-graphs will furthermore create a better overall experience for the reader of the project report.

\subsection{Visualization and graph theory}
A very important part of this project is that the graphs must be beautiful and informative. When looking at the movie created from the $\beta$-reductions it should be possible to get an idea of the lambda term and how the $\beta$-reductions evolve. To accomplish this task, knowledge about visualization and graphs is necessary.

\subsection{Python development of the visualization software}	
The software itself is planned to be developed in Python. The software will basically consist of three elements; an interpreter of lambda expressions, a backend computing reduction graphs and last a program that, given a reduction graph, will draw the graphs and render the movie. A design like this will make it possible to independently exchange the three elements.

\section{Learning Goals}
The learning goals are developed from the project objectives described above. The list below describes our specific learning goals:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Establish an overall knowledge regarding Lambda Calculus and $\beta$-reduction-graphs.
	\item Get an insight into application development in python.
	\item Study visualization and graph theory, with the focus on making the reduction graphs both beautiful and informative
	\item Develop software that will enable the user to easily acquire understanding of the $\beta$-reductions for a given lambda expression.
	\item Design the software so that each of the three programs can work independently of the other two.
\end{itemize}


\section{Project Schedule}
In the project we will have some main areas (or phases) to cover. When working iteratively on a project many of these phases will overlap, since we will be working on several areas in the same time period. The project will stretch over a period of 5 month.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Write report - 5 month
	\item Focus on the lambda calculus theory - 1 month
	\item Designing the look of the visualization - 3 month
	\item Implementation of the software - 4 month
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[-] Lambda expression parser - 2 weeks
		\item[-] Reduction graphs generator - 2 month
		\item[-] Graphs generator - 3 month
	\end{itemize}
	\item Testing the software - 3 month
\end{itemize}
