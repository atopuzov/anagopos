----- Must have features -----
 - Draw New term [button] (pop-up box with settings)
	 - Enter term / Generate semi-random term
	 - Set term settings (e.g. number of reductions)
	 - Select drawing algorithm
	 - select between color schemes
	 
 - Redraw Current Graph Completely [button] (redraw graph with new random node positions) (Shortcut: Shift-R)

 - Optimize Graph Drawing of Current term [button] (redraw graph with the already calculated node positions) (Shortcut: Shift+O)
 
 - Step Forward in Current Term [button] (Shortcut: Shift+F)

 - Step Backward in Current Term [button] (Shortcut: Shift+B)

 - Settings [button] (pop-up box with settings) (Shortcut: Shift+S)
	 -- Hvilke settings menes der her? Farver og den slags? Er det ikke de
		samme settings som i "Draw new term[...]"?

 - Click on node to get term displayed (left-click)

 - Click on node to get all outgoing edges highlighted (Shift+left-click)

 - Design a proper interface that can abstract away the type of algorithm, and
	whether it is a GrahViz- or a home-cooked one. Must be easily extendable.

 - Compare lambda terms better. Using the string comparison method is slow.

 - When generating reduction graph with the "generator"-function, initialize
   OpenGL stuff in the beginning and set it to listen to "graph ready"-events.
   This way, the visualization begins immediately, reducing the perceived overhead.

----- Nice to have features -----
 - Zoom in to node

 - Dragging a node to re-organize graph

- Highlight different reduction strategies?

- Home-cooked pickling. Pickle and cPickle cannot handle large reductiongraphs.
